## API Testing with Postman ‚úÖ

All API endpoint tests were conducted by **Zaynab Raounak** using [Postman], a powerful tool for testing and exploring REST APIs.  

### Details of the tests performed:

- **User Creation (`POST /register`)**: Zaynab Raounak verified user registration with both valid and invalid data.
- **Login (`POST /login`)**: Tested login scenarios, including correct and incorrect credentials.
- **Adding Courses (`POST /courses`)**: Validated permissions and the format of the data sent.
- **Course Enrollment (`POST /enroll`)**: Verified the proper functioning of enrollments.
- **Profile Display (`GET /users/<id>`)**: Tested retrieval of user data for different profiles.

The tests conducted by **Zaynab Raounak** confirmed that the API responds correctly in various use cases (success, validation errors, insufficient permissions). These tests helped identify and resolve several areas for improvement.
